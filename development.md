# Development tools



## [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

IntelliJ IDEA is an IDE. The JetBrains product for the development of web and Windows software as well as many applications.
It is developed by JetBrains (formerly known as IntelliJ), and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition,[5] and in a proprietary commercial edition. Both can be used for commercial development.
IntelliJ offers developers a number of tools for refactoring, software testing, and more. In particular, the code coverage analysis and the integrated version controls systems are both particularly helpful.  IntelliJ supports lots of other languages, including Java, Groovy, and Scala. More options are available in the Ultimate version. However, the relatively stripped down Community version is still a powerful option for developers.

## [Eclipse Neon](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
One of the other IDEs that can be named is the Eclipse.  To use Kotlin on the Eclipse, the plugin must be added. for more details you can see [Getting Started with Eclipse Neon](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started-eclipse.html).

## [TryKotlin](https://try.kotlinlang.org/#/Examples/Hello,%20world!/Simplest%20version/Simplest%20version.kt)

This simple text editor is a cloud-based application available in the browser that is compatible with any operating system. This JVM allows developers to run the code as soon as they finish typing it.

TryKotlin is a pretty lightweight text editor, but it supports modular testing of Junit and a Java to Kotlin code converter. In keeping with its introductory nature, TryKotlin has quite a few examples of premade code for basic Kotlin functions. Other features include JavaScript and Canvas support, as well as a save and share function for any code written.

## [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

Android Studio provides the developers with fast tools for building apps on every type of Android device. Android Studio has had full support for Kotlin since May 2017, with support for standard components and Android templates.

Since there are pretty significant design similarities between Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA, it makes it even easier for developers to transition to create mobile applications with this IDE. 

## [Vim](https://www.vim.org)

features of vim  include a multi-level undo tree, extensive plugin system, and powerful search and replace. As befitting an editor that is old enough to rent a car, Vim has support for hundreds of programming languages and file formats. With a Kotlin plugin, developers can take advantage of syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, code checking with Syntastic, and more.

## [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)

Sublime Text 3 is a sophisticated text editor with great features for code, markup, and prose.
Features include syntax highlighting, errors detection, and autocompletion. Multiple selections saves times while making changes and the command palette simplifies looking for tools. Developers are able to make their own templates and quickly insert them into a file as well as create their own extensions. Sublime Text also offers a built-in Java compiler called JavaC, along with a powerful API and package ecosystem.
